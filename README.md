# Astro-Lander Game

## CESI x HARFANG Workshop

Astro-Lander is a game prototype co-created during a 1-day workshop between [CESI Nanterre](https://paris.cesi.fr/) & [Harfang 3D](https://www.harfang3d.com). The game relies on realtime physics to challenge the player on their skills to counterbalance gravity and inertia.<br>
Astro-Lander is implemented in [Python](https://www.python.org/) :snake:

* All the levels where created by CESI students.
* Some of the game logic was implemented by the students.
* The game is open source and can be re-used for any other purpose.

## If you want to play :video_game:
 - Download the [latest release](https://github.com/harfang3d/game-astro-lander/releases) (look for a file like ` astrolander_xxx.zip`)
 - Unzip it
 - Run `2-run.bat` (or `3-run vr.bat` if you feel lucky and have SteamVR installed with a VR headset)

   - :arrow_left: Thrust `left`
   - :arrow_right: Thrust `right`

 - If your fuel reach `0`, you die
 - Press `k` to enable the `AAA` rendering mode (realtime GI and reflections)
